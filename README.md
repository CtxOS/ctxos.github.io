## Overview

The **Debian Base Kit** is a professional-grade, modular toolkit to build, manage, and ship custom Debian-based Linux distributions across multiple architectures.

From single commands to automated pipelines, it empowers distro maintainers and developers with:

- Multi-architecture (x86_64, ARM64, RISC-V, Raspberry Pi) image builds
- Unified package management (APT + Flatpak + Meta-packages)
- Advanced system services secured via DBus & Polkit
- Proactive auto-updates, snapshot-protected migrations & rollback
- Fully localized UI with hardware-aware intelligent stack suggestions
- Integrated CI/CD pipeline with release orchestration and live ISO generation
- Docker, VM, and WSL2 development environments for portability
- Centralized archive, mirror sync, and project packaging system

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Debian-based development host (Ubuntu, Debian, etc.)
- Python 3.9+ and dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- Docker (optional, for containerized dev environment)
- QEMU + KVM (optional, for VM testing)

### Quickstart

### 📊 Build Pipeline Visualizer
CtxOS includes an interactive workflow visualizer to understand and manage the build process:
```bash
cd workflow
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
Then visit:
- `http://localhost:3000/ctxos` - CtxOS Build Pipeline
- `http://localhost:3000` - AI Agent Builder (general purpose)

See `workflow/README.md` and `workflow/INTEGRATION.md` for details.

### Installation
To install the default (**base**) profile:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/CtxOS/CtxOS.git
cd CtxOS

# Build and launch the Software Center Webview UI
pip install pywebview
python3 software-center/webview_launcher.py
````

### Building a Multi-Arch Image

```bash
# Build images for Raspberry Pi, ARM64, and RISC-V
BUILD_MULTI_ARCH=true ./scripts/pipeline-master.sh
```

### Running in Docker

```bash
./scripts/docker-run.sh
```

### 🐳 Security Container Images

CtxOS provides a suite of specialized security container images (Core, Security, and individual Tools). See the [containers documentation](./containers/README.md) for details.

```bash
cd containers
./build.sh
```
